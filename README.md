# CourseHelpr

## Overview
CourseHelpr is an AI-powered learning tool designed to enhance student engagement and understanding by transforming traditional learning materials into interactive experiences.

## The Problem
Students often face challenges in learning due to:

- **Asynchronous Learning Gaps** – While asynchronous learning offers flexibility, it lacks engagement, real-time feedback, and personalization, making it harder for students to stay motivated and fully understand material.
- **Catching Up on Missed Lectures** – When students miss classes, they rely on static lecture notes or recordings that don’t provide interaction or clarification, making it difficult to catch up efficiently.
- **Lack of Personalized Tutoring** – Traditional tutoring can be expensive or unavailable when needed. Generic study materials don’t adapt to individual learning paces, leading to gaps in understanding.

CourseHelpr aims to overcome these challenges by offering:

- **Interactive Games** – Engaging activities with points and rewards to enhance learning.
- **Quizzes and Feedback** – Real-time assessments to help students track progress.
