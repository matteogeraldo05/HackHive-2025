# CourseHelper

## Overview
CourseHelper is an AI-powered learning tool designed to enhance student engagement and understanding by transforming traditional learning materials into interactive experiences.

## The Problem
Students often face challenges in learning due to:

1. **Asynchronous Learning Gaps** – Online learning lacks real-time feedback, making it difficult for students to stay motivated.
2. **Catching Up on Missed Lectures** – Students rely on static resources that do not provide interactive explanations or personalized reinforcement.
3. **Lack of Personalized Tutoring** – Generic study materials do not adapt to individual learning needs, leading to gaps in understanding.

## Proposed Solution
CourseHelper aims to overcome these challenges by offering:

- **Interactive Games** – Engaging activities with points and rewards to enhance learning.
- **Quizzes and Feedback** – Real-time assessments to help students track progress.
- **Personalized Learning Paths** – AI-generated adaptive learning experiences.
- **AI Chatbot** – Instant support for student queries.
- **Easy-to-Use Software** – A user-friendly interface for all learners.
